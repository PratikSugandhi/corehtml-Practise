                What is Web Designing?
                Web designing is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and implementing the plan for designing a website in a way that is functional
                and offers a good user experience. User experience is central to the web designing process. Websites have an array of elements presented in ways
                that make them easy to navigate. Web designing essentially involves working on every attribute of the website that people interact with,
                so that the website is simple and efficient, allows users to quickly find the information they need, and looks visually pleasing.
                All these factors, when combined, decide how well the website is designed.
